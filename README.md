# js-test
Problem 1 is in the jsProbOne directory and can be tested using jsFiddle to save from having to do <!Doctype>, and linking the files. 

Problem 2 is in the jsProbTwo directory and can also be tested using fiddler. Both parts are in the directory. 

Problem 3 is the first link in the jsFiddles.txt file
Problem 4 is the second link in the jsFiddles.txt file
Problem 5 is the third link in the jsFiddles.txt file

Problem 6 and 7 can also be run in jsFiddle or via a snippet in chrome dev tools...anywhere that you have a javascript interpreter, they can be run.
